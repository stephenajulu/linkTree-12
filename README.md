# linkTree
This project is a simple linkTree to connect my social media handles using HTML, CSS.

linkTree is a free tool for social media influencers to help optimise their instagram traffic. Using linkTree, you get one link that you cann add to your instagram bio that will lead your followers to the website housing all your content. 

The official website is https://linktr.ee/

My linkTree project has three links taking users to my LinkedIn profile, Github page and my website.

As mine is a static website, I deployed it using GitHub Pages.
